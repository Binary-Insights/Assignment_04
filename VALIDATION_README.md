## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before running ANY guide, verify:

- [ ] **Qdrant Running:** `docker ps | grep qdrant`
- [ ] **Structured Data:** `ls data/structured/ | wc -l` (at least 1 file)
- [ ] **Raw Data:** `ls data/raw/*/*/text.txt | wc -l` (has files)
- [ ] **Environment:** `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY` (not empty)
- [ ] **Script Exists:** `ls scripts/rag/validate_extraction_sources.py`

**Fix Missing Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Start Qdrant
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Extract data (creates structured files)
python scripts/rag/structured_extraction.py --company-slug world_labs

# Check environment
cat .env | grep -E "OPENAI_API_KEY|QDRANT_URL"
```
